Project from "The Web Developer Bootcamp"

The "Color Game Project" has helped me to understand how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and at the same time, how to work correctly with GitHub.
I created a "branch" of the project and worked on it, in order to merge it to the "master branch" at the end of the day.
